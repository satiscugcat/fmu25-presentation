   Today I'll be talking about some of the work I've been doing at CRYSPEN, involving Rust! 
* What exactly am I talking about?
  
** SIMD and Vector Intrinsics

   SIMD stands for Single Instruction, multiple data. Vector intrinsics are special functions offered by the compiler, that allow the use of SIMD instructions.
** SIMD in Rust
   The core::arch crate (the Rust equivalent of a C library) is responsible for exposing these vendor-specific intrinsics that typically correspond to a single machine instruction.
   #+begin_src rust
   /// Simple program squares elements in 16 bit chunks.
   use core::arch::x86_64::*;
   fn main() {
       unsafe {
   	let a : __m256i = _mm256_set_epi16
   	    (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15);
           let b : __m256i = _mm256_mullo_epi16(a, a);
   	println!("{}",_mm256_extract_epi16::<0>(b));
   	println!("{}",_mm256_extract_epi16::<15>(b));
       }
   }
   #+end_src

   Rust has been finding popular use in new security-critical and performance-sensitive projects, and SIMD vector intrinsics are often used for performance/efficiency in such projects.

* Why are there problems?
** Rust Docs
   Let us imagine ourselves as a Rust developer looking through these intrinsics. Let us say we want to understand the intrinsic "vabdq_s8", in core::arch::aarch64, used for performing an absolute difference. Since we are Rust developers, our first instinct is to look at the Rust docs. A quick google search leads us to this.

** ARM Docs
   Not a great start. The Rust documentation barely explains anything, all it does is link to the ARM documentation. But atleast the ARM docs are nice! There is some pseudocode to accompany it too.

   The ARM docs say "Signed Absolute Difference. This instruction subtracts the elements of the vector of the second source SIMD&FP register from the corresponding elements of the first source SIMD&FP register, places the the absolute values of the results into a vector, and writes the vector to the destination SIMD&FP register."

   Perfect! It does what we want it to, we use it within a function we're writing. We use it as appropriate. 
** panic!()
   Dutiful and diligent programmers that we are, we also write unit tests for the function we've written. Everything seems fine, but when we run the tests, they fail! After hours of debugging, in what feels like a miracle, we find the issue.
   
   #+begin_src rust :eval never
   #[cfg(target_arch="aarch64")]
   use core::arch::aarch64::*;
   #[cfg(target_arch="aarch64")]
   fn main() {
       unsafe {
	   let a = vld1q_s8(&(127 as i8) as *const i8);
	   let b = vld1q_s8(&(-2 as i8) as *const i8);

	   let result = vabdq_s8(a, b);
	   let result = *(&result as *const int8x16_t as *const [i8; 16]);

	   println!("{}", result[0])
       }
   }
   #+end_src

   #+begin_src bash :dir ./example/ :results output :eval yes
   cross run --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:

** Rust Source, Maybe?
   Again, dutiful and diligent programmers that we are, we might be concerned that this is a bug in Rust! The ARM documentation very clearly states what's supposed to happen, with no mention of UB. Thus, we take a look at the rust-lang/std-arch repository, and try to find the implementation of the intrinsic.
   
   #+begin_src rust :eval never
   pub fn vabdq_s8(a: int8x16_t, b: int8x16_t) -> int8x16_t {
       unsafe extern "unadjusted" {
           #[cfg_attr(
               any(target_arch = "aarch64", target_arch = "arm64ec"),
               link_name = "llvm.aarch64.neon.sabd.v16i8"
           )]
           #[cfg_attr(target_arch = "arm", link_name = "llvm.arm.neon.vabds.v16i8")]
           fn _vabdq_s8(a: int8x16_t, b: int8x16_t) -> int8x16_t;
       }
       unsafe { _vabdq_s8(a, b) }
   }
   #+end_src

   The Rust code seems to use FFI to make a call using LLVM IR! So there's no way the Rust Source is wrong. Frustrated with the hours we spent on this, we sit back and relax, being done for the day.
   
** The Moral of the Story
   Essentially, bad documentation means that even the best Rust programmers need to wade through Intel or Arm assembly documentation (and more!) to understand these intrinsics. And, when formally verifying cryptographic libraries, each project needs to define its own semantics for SIMD instructions, such SIMD specifications have been defined projects in F*, EasyCrypt, and HOL Light.
   
   
* How are we fixing this?
